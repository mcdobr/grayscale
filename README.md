# Grayscale

A small (command line) program built using OpenCV that gives out the greyscale of an image (turns it into black & white).

## Installation

You need to have the OpenCV library installed and configured properly on your platform to run this.

### Linux
Assuming $ is the command prompt.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mcdobr/grayscale
$ cd grayscale
$ make
$ ./grayscale path_to_image_file
```
